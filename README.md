# phoneBook

The phone book/address book  web application that was made is a free to use database login web app, that can be accessed on any device in the world to easily store phone numbers and contact information. The application was created using sqlalchemy, flask and html/css. The final product of the project can be seen in the link below:

The main achievments of this project was to incorporate web development skills using the python flask module. This allowed all the backend work (for the webapp) to be done in python. In addition, HTML/CSS as well as some JavaScript functions were used to create the front-end website for the users. Finally, an SQL database was used in order to store the phone numbers, in accordance with individual user accounts / person. This was used to create user accounts and allow them to sign in at a later time, as well as to fetch / delete the data that was assosiated with their accounts at any given time.
